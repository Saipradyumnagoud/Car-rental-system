# Car Rental Management System

This program is a simple car rental management system written in C. It allows users to rent cars, return rented cars, and calculates rental fees based on the duration of rental.

## Features

- Rent a car: Users can select a car from available options and rent it for a specified period.
- Return a car: Users can return a rented car and calculate the final rental fee based on the duration of use.
- Display available cars: Users can view the list of available cars along with their models and daily rental rates.

## How to Use

1. **Compilation**: Compile the program using a C compiler. For example, using `gcc`:
   ```
   gcc -o car_rental car_rental.c
   ```

2. **Execution**: Run the compiled program:
   ```
   ./car_rental
   ```

3. **Interaction**: Follow the prompts to either rent a car or return a rented car. Enter the required information as prompted.

## Dependencies

- Standard C libraries (`stdio.h`, `string.h`)

## Note

- This program assumes a fixed set of cars with predefined brands, models, and rental rates.
- Car availability is based on a simplistic approach and does not include real-time updates.
- Users are responsible for any damages incurred during the rental period.
